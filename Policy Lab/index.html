                Directs a county elections official conducting an all-mailed ballot election to consider vote center location on a public or private university or college campus. Expands the definition of ""public building"" for purposes of that provision to include buildings owned or controlled by community college districts, the California State University, and the University of California, and it would also clarify that the University of California is encouraged, but not required, to comply with such a request.
